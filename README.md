## RECOMMENDATIONS
Through effective data visualization and insightful analysis gathered, I will recommend these for the company.
1. Provide recommendations to optimize sales and increase profitability, which are as follows
- Create a good brand identity that accurately represents what the business is all about and resonates with your target audience, likewise brand visibility with the help of some social media platforms like facebook, Instagram that can drive sales through the use of paid adverts
-	Empowering sales team with important resources, trainings and motivation to engage customers and contribute to revenue growth
-	Marketing strategies should be implemented to focus on products and regions with low sales.
-	Products with little or no discounts should also be looked into. 
2. Suggest strategies to improve customer satisfaction and retention by doing these
- Aside from discounts, incentive like free shipping can also help customers make purchases across the regions
- Providing excellent customer service can help increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases. Making sure there are offers like live chat, phone and email support to help with complaints and enquiries
- Store policies can make or break sales, so the company should consider having a good implemented not too strict return or refund policies
